# Crimsonland-style Shooter Game (Python Flask + Phaser.js)

This project is a browser-based top-down shooter inspired by Crimsonland. The backend uses Python Flask to serve the web app, and the frontend uses Phaser.js for real-time gameplay.

## Features
- Top-down shooter gameplay
- Player movement and shooting
- Basic enemy spawning
- Runs in any modern browser

## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies
```
pip install flask
```

### 2. Run the app
```
python app.py
```

Then open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## Project Structure
- `app.py` — Flask backend
- `templates/index.html` — Main HTML page (loads Phaser.js and game code)
- `static/` — Static files (JS, CSS, images)

## Next Steps
- Implement player, enemies, and shooting in JS
- Add more features: power-ups, score, waves, etc.
